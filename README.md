# Waddle Bot

The cutest and bestest Discord Bot! (My mom said so at least)

## About

This is a discord.js bot I'm doing for fun in my free time. If you want to invite the bot for some reason I won't be able to understand, [click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=723224456671002674&scope=bot&permissions=8 "Waddle Bot Invite").  
The current global prefix is **`w?`**, however once I get a database, this prefix will be able to be configured per guild.  
Run `w?help` for an overview of all commands.

## Upcoming Features

I will be getting a database for this project soon. This will let me be able to create a lot of cool new features, including:

-   Guild Configurations (Custom prefixes, Welcome/Leave Messages, Modetator Roles)
-   An experience system
-   A moderation system for logging infractions/warnings
-   Other small cool stuff like reminders

I will also be looking into getting a hosting provider for the bot to be online 24/7. However, as this still is only a fun project, I'm not sure if I want to spend money on it for now.
