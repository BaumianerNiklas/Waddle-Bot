# Waddle Bot

The Discord Bot that waddles, written in TypeScript and discord.js v13!

This bot is mainly focused around Fun features like Hangman, TicTacToe, and Image Manipulation but also provides some multipurpose/utility features, like generating an invite for Voice Activities.

## TypeScript Rewrite

This bot was completely rewritten in TypeScript and discord.js v13. The old code was a huge mess and had a lot of inconsistencies and bad practices. There is still a pretty big amount of commands that are not currently in this version, some of which will still be added, and some of which will be scraped completely. The old code is still there under the [v1 branch](https://github.com/BaumianerNiklas/WaddleBot/tree/v1) (mainly for archival purposes
so I can keep track of commands that I could still bring over).
