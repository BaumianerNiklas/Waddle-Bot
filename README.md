## Note

This code base is kind of messy and not really the greatest at the moment. Once Discord.js v13 releases on stable, I'm planning on completely rewriting this bot in TypeScript and implementing the new Discord features like slash commands, buttons, and maybe select menus and threads once those get public.

# Waddle Bot

The cutest and bestest Discord Bot! (My mom said so at least)

## About

This is a discord.js bot I'm doing for fun in my free time. If you want to invite the bot, [click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=723224456671002674&scope=bot&permissions=8 'Waddle Bot Invite').  
The current global prefix is **`w?`**, however once I get a database, this prefix will be able to be configured per guild.  
Run `w?help` for an overview of all commands.
(Currently not really working on the bot.)

## Features

Waddle Bot has a lot of commands for Utility and Fun, while providing a few simple tools for managing & moderating your servers!

### Autoquote

## Upcoming Features

I am not really working on this bot much as of this moment, but I do plan on getting a database for it sometime in the feature. A database would allow features like:

-   Guild Configurations (Custom prefixes, Welcome/Leave Messages, Modetator Roles)
-   An experience system
-   A moderation system for logging infractions/warnings
-   Other small cool stuff like reminders

I will also be looking into getting a hosting provider for the bot to be online 24/7. However, as this still is only a fun project, I'm not sure if I want to spend money on it for now.
